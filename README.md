Hi, I'm delta. I am some random guy from Germany who likes Coding (still can't code smh), Linux, and anything else related to Tech.
I use [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/) (with [Bedrock Linux](bedrocklinux.org/) installed) on my Laptop on a daily basis since March 25th 2023. I've stopped using Windows 10 since then.
Below is my OUTDATED Neofetch:
